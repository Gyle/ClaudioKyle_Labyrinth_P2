## Debugging
Currently Right click is Debug Mode. In this mode, left click opens and closes all doors. The purpose of the mode is to quick test enemy interation and enemy nav mesh. In addition to testing for other features without needing to traverse the whole scene properly as that takes time.

## Architecture of the Game
I will only mention commits for libraries I modified and what I found to be the most challenging and interesting part of the prototype. This is because there is too many commits to reference for my code.

### Kyle's Coding Report
Other than modifcations to library scripts, I have created scripts for handling enemy actions, dying, and pit fall event.

##### Enemy Actions
The enemy is attached to the EnemyController.js script. The role of this script is to patrol the area using a set of waypoint
that I provide to the enemy controller. It utilises  Nav Mesh Agent for its path finding logic. It is also aware if the 
trap door has opened, meaning it will not walk off into the pit or try to path find to the other side. In addition, it 
has a trigger on enter function for its agro range. It will de-agro once the path to the player partial. It knows when to 
animate itself for the right actions of walk, idle.

##### Player Actions
Movement is done by a Unity Standard library. However, I have script named DeathController.cs for knowing when the player has died. 
This class notifies the DeathEventManager.cs file if the player has touched the enemy or fell into the pit. In addition, it animates 
the enemy to attack the player if it touched the player.

##### Environment Mechanics
A main feature of this game is the environment. The mechanic to de-ago the enemy is done through using the doors to block it enemy 
path to the player. This was done through attaching nav mesh obstacles on the doors and doorways to ensure enemies cannot 
pass through close doors. Furthermore, the enemy can be dealt with by using the trap door. This particular environment mechanic is 
handled by the PitFallBehaviourApplier.cs file. This script is attached to trap doors. A trap door will have a box collider and a nav mesh obstacle for carving out the nav mesh, depending on position. When trap door is released, both box collider and nav mesh obstacle move down to squish the enemy with a trigger box. If the enemy touches this trigger, apply physics to the enemy by disabling nav mesh and applying rigid body attributes.

#### Goal Sequence
Once the player reaches a certain point on the goal stairs, there is simple logic for checking if this scenario occured. I created 
LevelLoader.cs which checks if the player collides with the stairs trigger box collider. Once this happens, it loads the next 
scene.


### Libraries Used
##### IvyMoon's Door Script
This script initially was made for first person perspective games to open doors. It would display GUI text regarding which button to
push to open or close. There was only a one to one relationship, meaning one door to one switch. Modifying this script was my first time coding in Unity3D and C#. Here are my modifications with corresponding `commit id`:

* Replaced option for single trigger switch to an array of switches `ed98e514cb23233a415501bb153bc46109b16847`
* Created for loops to go through every switch to see if the player pressed the open or close button near the switches that opens the door `ed98e514cb23233a415501bb153bc46109b16847`
* Added detection for clicking on the switch instead of using a button to open the switch `f037c5a87583d2d97e2885ec6832af9e9c58b54a`
* Added logic for only opening door if player clicked on switch they're standing next to `b91c23fee751bef2c50c6f5658825f1f7d5eeb0c`
* Animate door when opening or closing `f94b3162c2da3383cae36f795dec85810bf6eef1`

##### Unity Standard Third Person Controller Script
I utilised Unity's script to make our player move. I downloaded a random humanoid asset from the asset store. I then
proceeded to add the third person controller script into the player to make it move. I also modified this code to 
stop the player from moving when they have died `6e8b70b8f0ab5eb54df54fd1727fb9d5d7201fe9`

##### Unity Nav Mesh
I utilised Unity's script to make our enemy move. It intelligently path finds and knows when doors is closed or if the 
trap door is open, indicating it cannoy cross the gap. All done with use of Nav Mesh Obstacle.

### Most Challenging and Interesting Part of the Prototype
Overall the most challenging part was using Unity 3D to link the game objects with scripts in the scene. All this GUI stuff 
was hard to work out in the early stages of development. In particular, see commit `ed98e514cb23233a415501bb153bc46109b16847`. 
Moreover, the challenge of solving why the dang enemy would not fall by gravity into my trap door mechanic despite carving out the nav 
mesh when releasing the trap door. Finding out that I needed to disable the nav mesh agent and set rigidbody's kinematic 
value to false, **AND** having to apply the GravityWeight propery to all animations was very interesting, **BUT** difficult nonetheless.
See commit `47447c36b428eebddec0311c7cc337ee733951a5`
